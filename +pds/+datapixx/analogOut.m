function analogOut(open_time, chan, TTLamp, sampleRate) 
% pds.datapixx.analogOut    Send a TTL pulse through the Analog Out
% Send a [TTLamp] volt signal out the channel [chan], for [open_time] seconds
% 
% Datapixx must be open for this function to work. 
%
% INPUTS:
%	      open_time - seconds to send signal (default = .5)
%              chan - channel on datapixx to send signal 
%                     (you have to map your breakout board [3 on huk rigs])
%            TTLamp - voltage (1 - 5 volts can be output) defaults to 3

% modified by wolf zinke, Feb. 2017 - put reward defaults into pds.behavior.reward.give
%                                   - encode events when analog channel is used
